Fun but simple problem.
Listed as hard on CTFlearn, but not very.

Cipher = ^&,*$,&),!@#,*#,!!^,(&,!!$,(%,$^,(%,*&,(&,!!$,!!%,(%,$^,(%,&),!!!,!!$,(%,$^,(%,&^,!)%,!)@,!)!,!@%
Given hint is !@#$%^&*( is 123456789

Using a very simple python script, decode each character of the cipher. 

We are given a string of numbers, which intially I thought was ASCII, but the first letter was not 'C'.

The challenge was called symbolic decimals, so I knew it was a decimal string instead that had to be decoded.

Used an online decoder to solve it because lazy to code in Python.

Used decoder.py to decode and print out the decimal string.
