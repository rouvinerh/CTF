Challenge gives us a .m4a file to download and hints that it is corrupted. 

I googled what's an m4a file and also read the strings of the file to verify that the header was right. The header was correct and I found some clues that Itunes was used somewhere in this file. 

A .m4a file is some kind of audio file that can be played, and the fact that it is corrupted shows that we have to somehow fix it. 
I just followed this website, but there are many ways of fixing a m4a file.
