This one isn't too hard.

From the challenge we can see that it gives us a long cipher and we have to decrypt it. 

The title hints at there being 'too many 64s', indicating that this process has to be done multiple times.

I used Decoder.py with the cipher given and the flag is automatically printed on screen.
