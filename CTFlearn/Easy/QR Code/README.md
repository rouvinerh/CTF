Going to the page gives us a QR code. 
Using your mobile device to scan the QR code gives us a cipher.
Cipher: c3ludCB2ZiA6IGEwX29icWxfczBldHJnX2RlX3BicXI=

There's an equal sign behind the cipher, looks like Base64.
Decoding it gives us: 
synt vf : a0_obql_s0etrg_de_pbqr

It looks like the flag and there are mostly letters in it.
Tested ROT13 (because its a CTF challenge lol) and it gave us the flag.
Flag : CTFlearn{n0_body_f0rget_qr_code}
