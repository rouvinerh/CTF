A fun little game of guessing a number to reach an absurd number.
Knowing that there's a way to play around with this, I tried entering a negative bet amount to see if it can do anything.

I entered the negative amount of the amount that was required.

The game says that the correct guess each time is 1-10.
My goal was to lose this bet, so I entered 0 for all guesses, and I got the flag.

This just goes to show that user input validation is so important.
