Gives us a cipher and a photo
Cipher: MQDzqdor{Ix4Oa41W_1F_B00h_m1YlqPpPP}'

Photo reveals some kind of matrix to decode the cipher with.

Upon inspection, I realised that the photo was the letters rearranged like a keyboard from left to right in a 5x5 grid.
One letter was missing and that was the letter J. 

Googling about ciphers with 5x5 grids gave me the result.
This challenge usews a Polybius Square to decode it.

Decoding it using online tools gave me the flag.
