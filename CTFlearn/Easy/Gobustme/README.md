Gives us a link to a website:
https://gobustme.ctflearn.com/

The website tells us to use the software called gobust, which searches through the whole directory to find stuff. 

Looking through the other link which is the word list throughout the thing, it gives us some common words to look through when using gobust.

I used DirBuster instead as I prefer it.

Enter the URL and copy the wordlist so the program knows what to look for.
This is a fun challenge, everything the DirBuster program picks up is a little joke :)

I just let the program run it's thing while doing other stuff and found the flag eventually after looking at the different files. 

DirBuster is something a hacker can use to scan a website for any extensions or files hidden within it's directories.
It uses a wordlist that you need to have, which can be found online.

This is a useful tool for information gathering as I understand it. 

Directory is https://gobustme.ctflearn.com/hide/
