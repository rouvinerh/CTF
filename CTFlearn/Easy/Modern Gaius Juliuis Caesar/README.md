Challenge is rated 30 points under Cryptography Category.

Gives us a cipher:
BUH'tdy,|Bim5y~Bdt76yQ

At first I thought it was a Caesar Cipher, but it's not.

The challenge hints at a keyboard of some sort, so I thought it was a keyboard shift cipher.

I just played around with a decoder and got the flag.
Take note that ~ was shifted to _.

Flag: CTFlearn{Cyb3r_Cae54r}
