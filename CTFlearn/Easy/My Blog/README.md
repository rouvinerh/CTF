Challenge is rated 20 points under Web Category.

The challenge gives us the actual creator's blog and to find the flag somewhere there.

The hint given was to find an application in the memory of the website.

This is a legitimate website, so there's no ground breaking bug to try here.

Spent a lot of time looking at task manager intially..thought it wanted me to analyze the memory usage.

Under the web developer tools, there's an 'Application' tab. After going into that, I looked for some sort of like storage or memory
thing.

Under local stroage there's one part with the flag in it.
