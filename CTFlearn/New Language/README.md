This challenge gives us instructions on how to create a custom langauge that reads the text character by character to alter a list.
I changed the final terminating character to be '$' instead for this challenge, which shouldn't cause much difference. 
For some reason, the code I wrote works with my test files but not with the actual file given, so I'm not really sure why,
I used newlanguage.py.
