Provides us with a .txt file full of symbols and a legend to what the legend means. Each character in the file represents an action we do to the list, which initially is 0. It then tells us to take the finalized list and convert it to letters from ASCII as the flag.

I cooked up a quick script of newlanguage.py to solve this one
