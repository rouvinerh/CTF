Challenge was under Misc. Category.

Challenge gave us a PGP Key ID and told us to look it up. PGP is an asymmetric cipher, which means there is a private and public key. I googled a lot on how to do this one, and ended up at some PGP database, and searching the Key ID given to us on that page gave us an email and a name. 

Unfortunately, I was unable to do anything more with this one despite trying really hard. It was not that easy to break this one unfortunately. I tried email databases and multiple different Linux tools but to no avail.

Looking forward to see the solution on this one!
