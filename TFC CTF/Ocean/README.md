Challenge was under Forensics Category.

This challenge involved using netcat to connect to an IP address.

Upon connection, it didn't show anything or do anything. I tried entering letters and it let me type it out. The hint given was that it was not broken and meant to be like that.
I tried typing ls and it replied back with a 'chal' file, which we were told to ignore.

I realized that this was just a Linux Terminal challenge. I played around, going into different directories until I just did ls -d -l in all the directories I was in and randomly found the flag.
