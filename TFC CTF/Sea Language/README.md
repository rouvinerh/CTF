There were two parts to this challenge.

SL1 gave us a .txt file with morse code in it, which was a giveaway.

SL2 gave us a .txt file with what looked like morse code, but it wasn't. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the each space was separated by exactly 8 characters, which looked a lot like binary.

I substituted the characters with 1s and 0s and decrypted it, giving me the flag.
