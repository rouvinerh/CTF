A recent CTF I did solo. First time doing an actual CTF alone :O

I completed 11/22 challenges, but all the pwn challenges were down before I could really start playing around with it. So I guess it's considered 11/17? No excuses LOL I just need to get gud

I had fun this CTF, despite spending like only a few hours on it and not really taking it seriously (due to duties that exist in real life), so I guess it wasn't as bad.

I ranked 76/689, which was alright I suppose!

Congratulations to all the winners! This was a fun challenge. This highlighted to me the need to learn how to use pwn and automate my tools LOL
