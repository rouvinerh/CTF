This was under Miscallenous Category.

We considered giving you a free flag. However, we decided against it. In general, we would never do that! Or would we? That's the beginning of a good CTF! Discord is the new Twitter.

To be able to solve this challenge, you'll need to join our discord. Link in the Rules page.

The challenge told us we had to join the Discord server made for the challenge, and hilariously people were spamming commands into the chat trying to get the one bot to spit out a flag.

Obviously it didn't work.

The admins gave the hint, 'general', 'beginning' and 'Twitter'.

I searched around, realized that the general meant the general thread inside the Discord and 'beginning' meant at the start of something.
Looking at when the CTF started didn't give me much information.

So, I started searching what does Twitter mean, and came across some kind of Twitter stenography, which involved having unicode characters. This website decodes those!

I scrolled up all the way and found one of the messages by the admin that looked kinda funny, and decoding it gave me the flag!
