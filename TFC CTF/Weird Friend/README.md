Challenge tells us that one of the guys in their story requested for a quick response, and his friend took it literally!. The file attached was a text file with binary in it, which was pretty weird as decoding it gave nothing.

I thought about it and wondered what does quick response really mean. Turns out it means QR, in QRcode.

Transalating the txt file contents into a picture, with 0 as a white pixel and 1 as a black pixel revealed a QRcode to scan, which gave the flag upon scanning it.
