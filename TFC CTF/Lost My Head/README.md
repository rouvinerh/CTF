Challenge was under Misc Category.

It gave us a .heic picture and told us to go and find out where exactly this place was in the world. This honestly stunned me and I didn't know where to begin at first.

I looked at the information of the file and found that it led to some place in Romania, there was a geotagging on it.

Going to google maps, I found the street name to be 4 Strada Simion Musat. 

Initially, I was just going to key this one in, but it didn't work. The admin gave me a hint to find out what Strada meant.

Turns out Strada means Street when traslated, and after rearranging the variables to follow the flag format given, I solved it pretty quick.

Flag format: TFCCTF{street_name_and_street_number_as_seen_on_google_maps_separated_by_underscores}
